### Instuctions to compile and run

* Compile using a C compiler such as cc, gcc, etc. (ex. "cc seating.c -o execName").
* User should run the program with the name of the input file as the 2nd command line argument (executable name first) and the name of the desired output file name as the third command line argument (ex. execName input.txt output.txt).
* The input file should be formattted as "R000 #" on each line, where the the reservation number should follow after "R" and follow the format: 001, 002, ... , 010. Also, the number of seats to reserve for that reservation should follow the reservation number, be separated by a single space, and can only be 3 digits at most.
